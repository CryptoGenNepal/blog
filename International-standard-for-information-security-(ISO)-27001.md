## ISO 27001 Introduction
**ISO 27001** is a primary international standard for information security (ISO). ISO-27001 is a component of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards for information security. The ISO framework is a set of rules and practices that companies may utilize. ISO 27001 establishes a framework to help companies of any size or industry protect their information in a systematic and cost-effective manner by implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

 
Not only does the standard offer businesses with the knowledge they need to protect their most precious information, but a company can also get certified against ISO 27001 and demonstrate to its clients and partners that it protects their data. Individuals can also obtain ISO 27001-related certifications by taking a course and passing the exam, demonstrating their abilities to future employers. ISO 27001 is easily recognized all around the world because it is an international standard, providing commercial potential for enterprises and people.

 
## About ISMS


ISMS is an abbreviation for "Information Security Management System." It is a documented management system that consists of a collection of security controls designed to safeguard assets' confidentiality, availability, and integrity against threats and vulnerabilities. Organizations may secure their confidential, personal, and sensitive data by creating, establishing, monitoring, and maintaining an ISMS.

## Needs of ISMS 


There are a rising number of rules, regulations, and contractual obligations pertaining to information security. Apart from the ISO 27001 standard providing an ideal way for complying with them, there are numerous other inherent benefits of implementing a proper ISMS.

* Achieve competitive advantage through Customer Confidence.

* Lower costs through Efficient implementations.

* Organized and Mitigated risks.

* Universal Vendor Requirements.
 

## How ISO 27001 work?

The goal of ISO 27001 is to preserve a company's information's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The basic idea of ISO 27001 is built on a risk-management process of identifying the risks and then addressing them methodically via the application of security measures. According to ISO 27001, a corporation must specify all controls that will be applied in a document called the Statement of Applicability. 

### Two parts of the standard 

The standard is divided into two sections. In the first, primary section, 

* Is made up of 11 clauses (0 to 10).

The second section, known as Annex A,

* Serves as a reference for 114 control goals and controls.

The ISO 27001 standard is introduced in Clauses 0 to 3 (Introduction, Scope, Normative references, Terms, and definitions). The following clauses 4 to 10, which provide ISO 27001 requirements that are required if the firm wishes to be compliant with the standard, are addressed in further detail in this article. The standard's Annex A provides a list of controls that are not obligatory but are chosen as part of the risk management process to supplement the clauses and their requirements.

## How to implement ISO 27001 controls?


Technical controls are typically applied in information systems by the addition of software, hardware, and firmware components. Periodic Backups, security software implementations, etcetera are some examples. Organizational controls are put in place by establishing the rules to be followed as well as the expected behavior of users, equipment, software, and systems like Access Control Policy, BYOD Policy, etcetera. Legal controls are implemented by ensuring that rules and anticipated behaviors adhere to and enforce the laws, regulations, contracts, and other similar legal documents with which the business is required to comply. For example, NDAs (non-disclosure agreements), SLAs (service level agreements), and so on. Physical controls are typically achieved via the use of equipment or technologies that interact physically with people and objects. CCTV cameras, alarm systems, locks, and so forth. Human resource controls are accomplished by giving people the information, education, skills, or experience they need to do their jobs safely. For example, security awareness training, ISO 27001 internal auditor training, and so on. 

**What is ISO 27001 certification?** 

An organization can obtain ISO 27001 compliancy certification by requesting a recognized certification body to execute the certification audit and, if successful, to provide the ISO 27001 compliance certificate to the organization. This certificate indicates that the organization complies completely with the ISOs 27001 standard. Individuals can obtain ISO 27001 certification after completing ISO 27001 training and passing the test. This certificate demonstrates that the individual has achieved the necessary abilities during the training.
