*This Is What Actually Facebookâ€™s SVG Malware Is Doing. We Had Used W3Schoolâ€™s IDE While Analyzing The Malicious SVG File. We Had Also Changed Some Code Of That Malicious SVGâ€™s File For Decryption Purpose, The Values Have Been Decrypted From The SVG File.*

  - After sending the SVG file could have been possibly been auto-loaded or could have required some user interaction.
  - It had been re-directed to [ mourid.com/php/trust.php ], as it was the place for a malicious extension.

  - After loading the page, it looked like a YouTube page. And a JavaScript alert pops out to install an extension.
  - The extension had been used for spreading the malware, and could also have been the backdoor for the attacker spreading ransomware.
  - The malware analysis has also been done by Payload Security, We can share the link if anyone is interested.

This Analysis Was Done By Me & Mr. Samir. While Analyzing This SVG Malware I Got Blocked By Facebook From Using Some Features Of Facebook Like Open Graph Actions etc
